Assumptions Made During Development

Single Currency Support:

The system assumes all transactions are in INR (Indian Rupee). Multi-currency support is not implemented.

Unique User Accounts:

Each user has one wallet account linked to their profile. Multiple wallets per user are not supported.

Sufficient Wallet Balance:

Users must maintain sufficient balance before making payments. No overdraft/credit feature is provided.

Transaction Atomicity:

All wallet updates (debit/credit) and ledger entries are treated as atomic operations. If one fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

Txn_ID Uniqueness:

Every transaction (txn_id) is assumed to be unique across the system. Client or server will reject duplicates.

PIN/Password Authentication:

Users are assumed to remember their login PIN and not share it with others. Biometric or 2FA support is not included at this stage.

No Third-Party Integrations:

Mobile recharges, bill payments, and UPI transfers are mocked/simulated. No actual telecom, biller, or UPI gateway integration is implemented.

Limited Scalability (for now):

The system is designed for demo & testing with SQLite. For production, it is assumed the system will be migrated to PostgreSQL/MySQL with connection pooling.

Timezone Handling:

All timestamps are stored in UTC (via datetime("now") in SQLite). Conversion to userâ€™s local time is assumed to be handled at the frontend.

Seed Data for Testing:

Preloaded users, wallets, and sample transactions are assumed sufficient for testing API flows without requiring real-world data.
